<h2>POST forms & Developer Tools</h2>
We want to get the cost per kilowatt hour of electricity for each ZIP code. We can use the Web site
<a href="https://www.directenergy.com/texas/electricity-plans">https://www.directenergy.com/texas/electricity-plans</a>
to get these.

<p>
At the very top of the page, there is a discreet
<code>Showing Texas. Change Region</code>
<p>
<img src="directenergy1.png" width="75%"></img>

<p>
If we click on the <code>Change Region</code> link, we get a popup window
and we can either select a different region in the country
OR specify a ZIP code on the right.
Let's enter 75007 as a sample ZIP code in Texas and then click Go.
<p>
This shows the page containing the rate

<br/>    
<img src="directenergyResult.png" width="75%"/>

<p>
We want to be able to do this for each ZIP code in Texas, and potentially 
the other regions also.

<p>
Later we'll see that we can remote-control a browser to automate this.
However, we don't have to resort to that for this situation.

<p>
Let's see what happens when we click Go having entered a ZIP code.
We'll look at the network requests the browser makes.
We do this using the Developer tools in the browser.
We'll use Firefox, but chrome works as well.
<p>
In Firefox, click Tools -&gt; Web Developer -&gt; Toggle Tools
This splits the window in half and shows the page you are viewing
and the collection of developer tools. 
<br/>
    <img src="developerTools.png" width="75%"/>
    
<p>
Select the Network tab.
Now enter a ZIP code and click Go.
Watch what happens in the Network tab. 
Each row is a request. 
We scroll to the top of this table and look at the first request.
It says
<pre>
301 POST electricity-plans
</pre>

<p>
Click on this row and  we get 
<br/>
<img src="directenergyRequestDetails.png" width="75%"/>

<p>

Next, click on the Params tab
<br/>
<img src="directenergyRequestParams.png" width="75%"/>

<p>
This shows the list of variables and their values that were sent in the POST request.

<p>
We are going to mimic this request in R, allowing the R user to specify a ZIP code.
<pre>
library(RCurl)
library(XML)
</pre>

We first visit the front page.
We'll create a connection and reuse it in all the requests.
This is a good thing to do generally as it avoids having to 
reestablish the connection to the same Web site for each request.
More importantly, it allows us to collect cookies and pass them back in each request
to maintain state across separate calls.  This may be necessary for some interactions.

<pre>
u = "https://www.directenergy.com/texas/electricity-plans"
con = getCurlHandle(followlocation = TRUE, cookiejar = "", verbose = TRUE, useragent = "R")
tt = getURLContent(u, curl = con)
</pre>
We specify followlocation so that we follow redirections to other pages (i.e. HTTP 300 codes)
and specify an empty cookiejar which tells curl to collect cookies and send them back to the
relevant host. We also are good citizens and specify a User-Agent  for the HTTP request header .


From the Developer tools, we see that we have a POST
request with a Content-Type header entry 
<pre>
application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
</pre>
The  parameters are 
<pre>
bundle_id	
service_address_1	
service_address_2	
goto_service_type	homepage
zipcode	75007
market_id	2
service_city	
service_state	TX
esiid	
utility_account_number	
premise_type	
ams	
address_valid	
service_zip_4	
service_zip_5	75007
</pre>

<!-- How did we know to switch to /texas/ -->


We mimic this request with
<pre>r
u2 = "https://www.directenergy.com/texas/electricity-plans"
ans = postForm(u2,
               bundle_id = "",
               service_address_1 = "",
               service_address_2 = "",	
               goto_service_type = "homepage",
               zipcode	 = "75007",
               market_id = "2",
               service_city = "",	
               service_state = "TX",
               esiid = ""	,
               utility_account_number	 = "",
               premise_type	 = "",
               ams	 = "", 
               address_valid = "", 	
               service_zip_4	= "",
               service_zip_5 = "75007", 
		    style = "post", curl = con)
</pre>

We can check that both 75007 and 9.7 appear in the document's content using grep().
We can also write the content to a file and view it in our browser (although
it may be missing some content that should come from the original server).

In the resulting HTML document, we look for 9.7 or Showing rate for:
to see how the rate is represented  in the HTML.
We see
<pre>
 &lt;div id="promoCTA"&gt;      
      &lt;div class="bundle-single-price-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="bundle-single-price"&gt;&lt;span&gt;9.7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&cent;&lt;/sup&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;/kWh&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="bundle-single-price-loc"&gt;Showing rate for: Houston area&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class="bundle-single-price-disc"&gt;
   &lt;a plan-name="Free Power Weekends 12" bid="817" class="noorder" href="#"&gt;Not in Houston? Get rates for your area&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;a plan-name="Free Power Weekends 12" bid="817" data-bundle-id="817" util="3" class="button order" href="#"&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Order now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

So let's assume this applies to other ZIP code, and perhaps even states.
We look for
<pre>
 div[@id = 'promoCTA']//div[@class = 'bundle-single-price']
</pre>

From the top of the document, the XPath query is
<pre>
doc = htmlParse(ans, asText = TRUE)
node = getNodeSet(doc, "//div[@id = 'promoCTA']//div[@class = 'bundle-single-price']")
</pre>

This returns one node.
Let's get the text for this
<pre>
xmlValue(node[[1]])
</pre>
We may want to get the text from each of the elements separately
<pre>
xmlSApply(node[[1]], xmlValue)
  span    sup     em 
 "9.7"    "Â¢" "/kWh"
</pre>


Let's make a function to get the rate for a given ZIP code in Texas.


<!--

75019  9.7
75002  8.7
75011  several for the Dallas region
