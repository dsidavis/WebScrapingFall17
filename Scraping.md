# Scraping Web Pages

Web Scraping (with one p, not two) is extracting content
from Web pages typically designed for humans to view.
The information is usually semi-structured, and we want to extract
it into structured data.

Because the pages are intended for humans, the layout can be achieved in many different ways to
create the appearance. This makes it hard to find the information we want. Furthermore, it can
readily change as people change the appearance of the page(s) without changing the content!
