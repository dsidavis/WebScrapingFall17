# Web Scraping & APIs

## Workshop Goals:
2. Understand the role of elements of the Web (HTTP, HTML, JSON, XPath, XML, JavaScript)
1. Become familiar with the essential tools to work with some of these
3. Explore strategies for extracting data.

The tools are important; the thought process is more important to learn.

e.g. &, ? since they are used in the URL for a purpose, and also characters
such as space, {, ...
